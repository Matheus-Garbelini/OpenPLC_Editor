Files changed from main Beremiz repo:

 - BeremizIDE.py:
Change PATH variable to include mingw

 - ProjectController.py
New toolbar buttons
Run function modified to clean, build, connect, transfer and run
Default scaling changed for new projects

 - features.py
Removed unused features

 - Viewer.py
Added force menu to FBD variables and coils

 - version.py
Changed version information

 - DebugVariablePanel.py
Fixed debug panel refresh on Windows

 - PouInstanceVariablesPanel.py
Called .upper() on all strings to make it conform to other debug strings

 - BlockPreviewDialog.py
Fixed refresh of graphic dialogs on Windows

- PLCObject.py
Added suport to load external python script to simulate a plant.
The model must implement the methods setup and loop to configure and
modify inputs/outpus of softPLC (new simulation thread added)

- BeremizIDE.py
Improved user experience:
* Automatically load first recent project
* Automatically open first project file (which usually is the ladder/structured code)

- ProjectController.py
* Added new options in the project configuration and new toolbar 
items to configure the model and simulation
* Added new parameters to be passed to the generate .c code. We have now access 
to more reflection of the variables inside the softPLC
* Removed Cleanup before compiling. Removing clenup saves a lot of time to start the simulation
and makes debugging the model more pleasant (stopping and starting a simulation much faster).

- targets/Linux and targets/Win32
Added new mutexes to handle the simulation thread.
if model is used, the setup() is called before the first PLC scan
which is useful to set default input values without recompiling softPLC code again


Also, images folder was changed with new icons and logos.
